# nmapscan

In the nmap scan with my 192.168.21.47 IP addresss,
I got TCP port 53 open 
Service "Domain"
Port 53 is a well-known port used for the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol.
It supports both Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
after that i saved scan details into an text file


After the nmap scanning 
I just packet capture using wireshark 
During the process i denote the TCP port 53
